## The Mission

Enterprise-grade security shouldn’t require enterprise budgets.

This site focuses on **practical cloud security for small teams** — the kind of security that works when you’re responsible for *everything*, not just one slice of the stack.

The goal is simple: make modern security achievable without excess tooling, process theater, or unrealistic assumptions.

---

## Who This Is For

- Security engineers on small or understaffed teams  
- DevSecOps practitioners dealing with SaaS sprawl  
- CISOs who need defensible, cost-aware decisions  
- Anyone tired of “best practices” that assume unlimited budget and time  

---

## What You’ll Find Here

Every article emphasizes:

- Working detection queries you can copy and adapt  
- Complete remediation paths, not just alerts  
- Honest tool comparisons (including limitations)  
- Compliance mappings (NIST, SOC 2, PCI-DSS)  
- Architectures that work on free or low-cost tiers  

---

## The Approach

1. **Vendor-agnostic analysis**  
   Tools are evaluated based on what they do, how they fail, and how they fit into real environments.

2. **No theory without practice**  
   Every recommendation is tested in a live environment.

3. **Free tier first, always**  
   Cost is treated as a design constraint, not an afterthought.

4. **No generic advice**  
   Specific tools, specific commands, specific outcomes.

## About Oob Skulden

Oob Skulden is a pseudonym.

I’ve spent over **30 years building and operating systems** — from early enterprise environments to modern cloud platforms — with the last **15+ years focused on security** as something that has to function under real-world constraints.

Today, I work in cybersecurity at a large organization (company name intentionally redacted).

## Why This Site Exists

Most security guidance assumes unlimited budget, specialization, and time.

Most teams don’t have that.

This site focuses on the **overlooked parts of modern systems** — where risk quietly accumulates — and shows how to address them with realistic detection and remediation strategies.

If you’re responsible for security *and everything else*, you’re in the right place.

---

## Site Context

This site is intentionally simple on the surface — but it is not just a static blog.

Oob Skulden™ serves as a **public research interface** for ongoing work in cloud security, SaaS risk, and automation. Articles often accompany:

- Working tools and prototypes  
- Homelab-backed experiments  
- Detection logic and policy models  
- Open-source research code  

The site itself is static by design.  
The work behind it is not.

Infrastructure, tooling, and experiments evolve continuously and are validated outside the site before anything is published here.

---

### Why This Matters

Most security writing stops at theory.

This site exists to document **systems that actually run**, including the mistakes made while building them and the lessons learned fixing them.

When something appears here, it has already been tested — often broken — and rebuilt.
