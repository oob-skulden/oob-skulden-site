# The Mission

Enterprise-grade security shouldn't require enterprise budgets. This site demonstrates how small teams can implement robust cloud security using:

- **Open source detection tools** (Steampipe, TruffleHog, Checkov)
- **Cloud provider free tiers** (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Automation that actually works**
- **Compliance mapping that auditors accept**

## Who This Is For

- Security engineers at companies with 1-5 person security teams
- DevSecOps practitioners drowning in SaaS sprawl
- CISOs who need to justify security investments
- Anyone tired of "best practices" that cost $50K+/year

## What You'll Find Here

Every article includes:

✅ **Working detection queries** you can copy-paste  
✅ **Complete remediation pipelines** with code  
✅ **Honest tool comparisons** (including limitations)  
✅ **Compliance mappings** (NIST, SOC 2, PCI-DSS)  
✅ **Free tier architecture** designs

## The Approach

1. **No vendor pitches** - Tools are evaluated objectively
2. **No theory without practice** - Every recommendation is tested
3. **No expensive solutions** - Free tier first, always
4. **No generic advice** - Specific tools, specific commands, specific results

## About Oob Skulden


**Oob Skulden** is my pseudonym name.

I’ve spent **over 30 years** building and operating systems across multiple generations of technology — from early enterprise environments to modern cloud platforms. My background includes deep, hands-on work with both Windows and Linux, long before either was considered “easy.”

Over the course of my career, I’ve worked across infrastructure, networking, data, and consulting roles, and I’ve spent **the last 15+ years focused on security** — not as an abstract discipline, but as something that has to function under real-world constraints.

Today, I work in cybersecurity at a large organization (**company name intentionally redacted**). The views and content here are my own and are not affiliated with my employer.

## Why this site exists

Most security guidance assumes unlimited budget, time, and specialization.

Most teams don’t have that.

This site focuses on practical cloud security for small teams: concrete detection ideas, realistic remediation patterns, and attention to the overlooked parts of modern systems where risk tends to accumulate quietly.

If you’re responsible for security *and* everything else, you’re in the right place.

**Homelab environment:** Proxmox cluster, HashiCorp Vault, multi-cloud free tier deployments

**Current focus:** Building practical security tooling that small teams can actually implement

## Site architecture (context)

This site is built and published using a deliberately simple workflow:

- Local development (static site generator)
- Version control in GitHub
- Static hosting and deployment

*(Currently implemented with Hugo and Netlify.)*

Most tools and checks published here were developed to support — or fix mistakes in — this workflow.  
They are designed to remain broadly reusable and are not tied to any specific platform or vendor.

As the site evolves, this architecture may change. The tooling philosophy will not.
