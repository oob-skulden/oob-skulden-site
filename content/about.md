## The Mission

Enterprise-grade security shouldn't require enterprise budgets.

This site focuses on **practical security for small teams** — the kind that works when you're responsible for *everything*, not just one slice of the stack.

The goal: make modern security achievable without excess tooling, process theater, or unrealistic assumptions.

---

## Who This Is For

- Homelab builders who want to do security right from the start
- Security engineers on small or understaffed teams
- DevSecOps practitioners managing tool sprawl
- Anyone tired of "best practices" that assume unlimited budget and time

---

## What You'll Find Here

Every article emphasizes:

- Working detection queries you can copy and adapt
- Complete remediation paths, not just alerts
- Honest tool comparisons — including limitations
- Compliance mappings (NIST, SOC 2, PCI-DSS)
- Architectures built on open-source and low-cost tools

---

## The Approach

1. **Vendor-agnostic analysis**
   Tools are evaluated based on what they do, how they fail, and how they fit into real environments.

2. **No theory without practice**
   Every recommendation is tested in a live environment.

3. **Open-source first, always**
   Cost is treated as a design constraint, not an afterthought.

4. **No generic advice**
   Specific tools, specific commands, specific outcomes.

## About Oob Skulden™

Oob Skulden is a pseudonym.

I've spent over **20 years across networking, systems administration, database engineering, and security** — from early enterprise environments to modern infrastructure — with the last **15+ years focused on security** under real-world constraints: limited budgets, small teams, and competing priorities.

I run an extensive homelab where every technique published here is tested first.

## Why This Site Exists

Most security guidance assumes unlimited budget, specialization, and time. Most homelabs and small teams don't have that.

This site focuses on the **overlooked parts of self-hosted infrastructure** — where risk quietly accumulates — and documents how to address them with realistic detection and remediation strategies, tested in a real homelab before they're published.

When something appears here, it has already been tested — often broken — and rebuilt. The articles reflect systems that actually run, including the mistakes made building them and the lessons learned fixing them.

If you're responsible for security *and everything else*, you're in the right place.

## Behind the Site

This site is static by design. The work behind it is not.

Articles are backed by homelab experiments, working tools, detection logic, and open-source research. Infrastructure and tooling evolve continuously and are validated before anything is published.
