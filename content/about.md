# The Mission

Enterprise-grade security shouldn't require enterprise budgets. This site demonstrates how small teams can implement robust cloud security using:

- **Open source detection tools** (Steampipe, TruffleHog, Checkov)
- **Cloud provider free tiers** (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Automation that actually works**
- **Compliance mapping that auditors accept**

## Who This Is For

- Security engineers at companies with 1-5 person security teams
- DevSecOps practitioners drowning in SaaS sprawl
- CISOs who need to justify security investments
- Anyone tired of "best practices" that cost $50K+/year

## What You'll Find Here

Every article includes:

✅ **Working detection queries** you can copy-paste  
✅ **Complete remediation pipelines** with code  
✅ **Honest tool comparisons** (including limitations)  
✅ **Compliance mappings** (NIST, SOC 2, PCI-DSS)  
✅ **Free tier architecture** designs

## The Approach

1. **No vendor pitches** - Tools are evaluated objectively
2. **No theory without practice** - Every recommendation is tested
3. **No expensive solutions** - Free tier first, always
4. **No generic advice** - Specific tools, specific commands, specific results
